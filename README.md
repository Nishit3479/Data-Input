# Data-Input

The following program takes input from the user through a GUI designed using Java Swing and then we store the data taken from the user into an Excel file using Apache POI.
In the following code "test.xlsx" named Excel file is being used but you can change the name and can use the file you want to use.

NOTE :
(1) There must an Excel file created with the same name and location as specified in the code before executing the program or you can make a new file with the name and location of your choice and you can give the path address in the line - 109 of the program.
(2) The code is being provided in a ".java" file. If you want to view it in notepad then change the extension from ".java" to ".txt".

Any doubts or queries? Feel free to ping me up any time
I will try my best to resolve it as soon as possible.

# Data-Input
Taking data as input from user through GUI made by Java Swing and then storing the data in an Excel file using Apache POI

The following program takes input from the user through a GUI designed using Java Swing and then we store the data taken from the user into an Excel file.
In the following code "test.xlsx" named Excel file is being used but you can change the name and can use the file you want to use.

NOTE :
(1) There must an Excel file created with the same name and location as specified in the code before executing the program.
(2) The code is being provided in a ".java" file. If you want to view it in notepad then change the extension from ".java" to ".txt".
